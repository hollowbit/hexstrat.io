This is just a little strategy game I made for fun. I just wanted to test out hexagon mouse clicking but ended up making a game. There are no plans for any more updates.

This project falls under the MIT license, basically meaning you can do whatever you want with the code and assets, but credit should be given.

## Running the Game

1. Make sure you have JDK 8 installed, with JAVA_HOME pointing to it. NOTE: This project uses an older gradle version that does not support Java 9+

2. Then simply execute the gradle script

```
$ ./gradlew desktop:run
```

This game supports Android (tested working). There are also other platforms that can be targeted, but without guarantees of success.
